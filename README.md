### Problem Statement Title
Automated intelligent humanoid robot in ICU
### Description
To design, develop and demonstrate the functioning of a reliable, cost effective, mechanised / automated intelligent humanoid robot to assist nurses in their daily tasks for moving and turning patients and giving the patients a bath

### Abstract 
Our aim is to build a cost effective humanoid to assist nurses in their daily tasks such as to turn, give bath and lift the patients without much physical efforts. Leveraging the experience of the trained eye (Nurse) and outsourcing the physically intensive tasks to the robot, our goal is to reduce the number of people and effort required to move a patient. 
This will be achieved with the help of a jacket to be worn by the nurse embedded with motion sensors which keep track of each and every movement of the nurse. The robot will imitate each and every action performed by the nurse thus helping her achieve the task which previously needed external help without disturbing other nurses and housekeeping staff.
The robot can be easily maneuvered throughout the ICU using a Joystick.
Using Artificial intelligence we judge the optimal location to support the patient. With the help of Deep learning and Machine learning we also avoid catheters, lines, tubes, bags and other sensitive equipment.
